# MMM-socialbicycles
<B>Station monitor</B> for the <B>socialbicycles (e.g. Wavelo in Krak√≥w, Poland)</B> bike-sharing network.<P>

This module is an extension of the amazing [MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) project by [MichMich](https://github.com/MichMich/) which has inspired me to share my coding skills with others as well. Check it out, you know you want to :). <P>

This module is based on [MMM-nextbike](https://github.com/yo-less/MMM-nextbike) by [yo-less](https://github.com/yo-less/). Thanks for the great work!

## Current version

v1.0.0

## Languages
As of version 1.0.0, MMM-nextbike features language support for `German (de)` and `English (en)` mirrors.

## Prerequisite
A working installation of [MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror)
 
## Dependencies
  * npm
  * [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
  * [xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js)

## Installation
1. Navigate into your MagicMirror's `modules` folder.
2. Execute `git clone https://github.com/0lek/MMM-socialbicycles.git`.
3. Execute `cd MMM-socialbicycles`.
3. Execute `npm install`.

## Module behavior
Please note that this module auto-creates a module header which displays the name of the chosen nextbike station. <BR>
It is therefore recommended not to add a 'header' entry to your config.js for this module.<P>
This module automatically disappears from your mirror as soon as a station has run out of bikes. It reappears shortly after the first bike has been returned to your chosen station.<P>
This module has been programmed to allow for multiple instances. Simply add more MMM-socialbicycles config entries to your config.js file to display multiple stations and configure them according to your needs.

## Configuration
Sample minimum configuration entry for your `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js`:

    ...
    
    {
        module: 'MMM-socialbicycles',
        position: 'top_left',
        config: {
            stationID: '', 		// Your station ID
        }
    } 							// If this isn't your last module, add a comma after the bracket
    
    ...


## Figuring out the correct cityID and stationID

That's a little bit complicated, but not too much. What I did - example based on Wavelo, but should be same for other
systems that use Socialbicycles infrastructure.

1. Go to en.wavelo.pl
2. Click on map
3. Right click on the map and select "Inspect Element" (for Safari)
4. Select the right-last tab, "Network"
5. Now click on the station in the map that you're interested in and observe the element inspector.
You'll be looking for a new row with a digit-only name and the domain *app.socialbicycles.com*.

6. Bingo! The number in the name column is the ID you want. You can right-click on the item and select "Open in New Tab". You'll get a JSON with all the data that's available. You can double-check there.
7. Enter the ID into the config.js file. That's it!
